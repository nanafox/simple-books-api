# Simple Books API

This is a simple books API from when I started learning about building APIs with
rails. I've just decided to leave it here as it is as a reminder of everything I
learned so far.

In my next projects, I may take on a similar project and make it much better but
as my mentioned earlier, this is to simply serve as a reminder of the early
days. This should have been shared a long time ago but as I kept coming back to
it, I realized it had to go public (haha).

Today (Saturday, November 23, 2024) is the day this is coming out. But this has
been here since (Monday, September 2, 2024).

After this project, I worked on [CommerceCore
Backend-as-a-Service](https://commercecore.lzcorp.tech), a very great
microservices-based backend solution for e-commerce solutions. Check out the
[website](https://commercecore.lzcorp.tech) or [GitHub
Repo](https://github.com/backendly/commercecore-product-management-service) for
more details
